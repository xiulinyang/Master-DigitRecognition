# Master-DigitRecognition
This is a group project for the course Machine Learning.
In this project, we tried to improve the performance of the model in the digit recognition task. Various methods including SVM, MLP and CNNs are empolyed and the final accuracy reached 98.5%.

This is my code for the experiments.
